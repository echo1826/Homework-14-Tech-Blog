# Description
This is a fullstack application that involves the use of a mysql database, an express server, and handlebars for HTML generation. This application is a blog website that allows users to make an account and login with their own account. It also allows user to make post threads and comments on those post threads for all users to see. It also allows users to delete their own post threads and comments.
